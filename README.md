# Sublime Text Snippets
[Reference Docs](http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/extensibility/snippets.html)

## Getting Started

**Clone** the repository.  
**SymLink** the repository to your sublime text snippets folder.  
````
mklink /j "C:\Users\agrc-arcgis\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User\snippets" "C:\Projects\Libraries\SublimeSnippets"
````  

It seems that sublime on `OSX` will find the snippets in a folder nested within `snippets`. The above doesn't _seem_ to have worked on `Windows`. I'll need to try it again.

If you have your own snippets you can symlink each snippet. Otherwise delete the folder and run the command.
